### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ethan Posner. I majored in computer science at Vancouver Island University. I mostly code in C# and Python, but have experience with JavaScript, PHP, HTML/CSS, C/C++, and Java.

Most of my time is focused at Yourgene Health Canada, where my team and I work hard to develop and maintain software for instruments that are used for [DNA size selection](https://yourgenehealth.com/our-products/technologies/next-generation-size-selection/).

I have lots of experience developing full-stack web applications using Python, PHP, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I gained lots of experience in this while working at [Bytedeck Learning Society](https://github.com/bytedeck) for my summer 2023 co-op.

I also developed [Tekku](https://github.com/Enprogames/Tekku) in collaboration with Nicholas Hopkins. It is a full-stack PHP forum website, allowing users to post images under various topics.

I am very interested in projects which involve processing large amounts of data and returning meaningful results based on it.

I am also very interested in low-level computing concepts, such as emulation of old hardware.

### My Projects

I've completed the following personal and collaborative projects:

- **[.NET Maui Flashcard Viewer](https://github.com/Enprogames/Maui-Flashcard-Viewer)**: A simple desktop/mobile application, created using .NET Maui, designed for creating and viewing flashcards.
- **[Bitcoin Research Project](https://github.com/Enprogames/Bitcoin_JanusGraph)**: Undergraduate research project with goal of developing methods for tracing bitcoin transactions. Uses the Janusgraph graph database to efficiently query bitcoin data in a graph format.
- **[Course Capsule](https://github.com/CSCI375-Stormtroopers/Course-Capsule)**: Website for students and teachers to share educational content for their courses, created using FastAPI, HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- **[Tekku](https://github.com/Enprogames/Tekku)**: A PHP forum website created using the L.A.M.P. stack, allowing users to post images under various topics. Dockerized to allow for easier deployment.
- **[SQL Injection Example Website](https://github.com/Enprogames/SQL-Injection-Example)**: Created in collaboration with Sebastian Van Den Bremt, a Django website that is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Demonstrates how easy this attack is to exploit.
- **[Flashcard Tool](https://github.com/Enprogames/Flashcard-Tool)**: A tool for memorizing large amounts of information. It has been a great aid to my own personal studying. 
    - Uses python's Tkinter GUI library
- **[Music Player](https://github.com/Enprogames/MusicPlayer)**: A small program which can be used to play song files.
    - Uses python's Tkinter GUI library
- **[Python Clock](https://github.com/Enprogames/Python-Clock)**: A clock I created for schools to show when a class is currently happening, when it will end, the current time, the current date, and a fact or joke at the top.
    - Uses python's eel GUI library. Also implemented using python's Tkinter GUI library.
