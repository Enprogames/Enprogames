### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth year student majoring in computer science named Ethan Posner, currently attending Vancouver Island University. I mostly code in Python, but have experience with JavaScript, PHP, HTML/CSS, C/C++, and Java.

I have lots of experience developing full-stack web applications using Python, PHP, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I gained lots of experience in this while working at [Bytedeck Learning Society](https://github.com/bytedeck) for my summer 2023 co-op.

I also developed [Tekku](https://github.com/Enprogames/Tekku) in collaboration with Nicholas Hopkins. It is a full-stack PHP forum website, allowing users to post images under various topics.

I am very interested in projects which involve processing large amounts of data and returning meaningful results based on it.

### My Projects
Most of my time is spent towards completing my bachelor's degree in computer science, but I'm also working on various programming projects.

I'm currently reading [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron. My goal is to become proficient with machine
learning so that I can implement it into my [stock trading program](https://github.com/Enprogames/Stock-Bot).

I'm currently working on:
- **[Bitcoin Research Project](https://github.com/Enprogames/Bitcoin_JanusGraph)**: Undergraduate research project with goal of developing methods for tracing bitcoin transactions. Uses the Janusgraph graph database to efficiently query bitcoin data in a graph format.
- **[Course Capsule](https://github.com/CSCI375-Stormtroopers/Course-Capsule)**: Website for students and teachers to share educational content for their courses, created using FastAPI, HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

I also have the following projects that I've created by myself in the past:
- **[Tekku](https://github.com/Enprogames/Tekku)**: A PHP forum website created using the L.A.M.P. stack, allowing users to post images under various topics. Dockerized to allow for easier deployment.
- **[SQL Injection Example Website](https://github.com/Enprogames/SQL-Injection-Example)**: Created in collaboration with Sebastian Van Den Bremt, a Django website that is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Demonstrates how easy this attack is to exploit.
- **[Flashcard Tool](https://github.com/Enprogames/Flashcard-Tool)**: A tool for memorizing large amounts of information. It has been a great aid to my own personal studying. 
    - Uses python's Tkinter GUI library
- **[Music Player](https://github.com/Enprogames/MusicPlayer)**: A small program which can be used to play song files.
    - Uses python's Tkinter GUI library
- **[Python Clock](https://github.com/Enprogames/Python-Clock)**: A clock I created for schools to show when a class is currently happening, when it will end, the current time, the current date, and a fact or joke at the top.
    - Uses python's eel GUI library. Also implemented using python's Tkinter GUI library.
