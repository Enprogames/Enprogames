### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A first year computer science major named Ethan Posner, currently attending Vancouver Island University. I mostly enjoy coding in Java, but have the most experience in Python.

I am very interested in projects which involve processing large amounts of data and returning meaningful results based on it.
