### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year student majoring in computer science named Ethan Posner, currently attending Vancouver Island University. I mostly enjoy coding in Python, but have experience with Java, C, Javascipt, and Ruby.

I am very interested in projects which involve processing large amounts of data and returning meaningful results based on it.

### Current Projects
Most of my time is spent towards completing my bachelor's degree in computer science, but I'm also working on various programming projects.

I'm currently reading [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron. My goal is to become proficient with machine
learning so that I can implemented into my [stock trading program](https://github.com/Enprogames/Stock-Bot).

I'm also working on the following projects
- [Flashcard Tool](https://github.com/Enprogames/Flashcard-Tool)
- [Music Player](https://github.com/Enprogames/MusicPlayer)
- [Python Clock](https://github.com/Enprogames/Python-Clock)
